Ahl At-Tasawoof

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AHL AT-TASAWOOF  AND THE PEOPLE WHO  ARE CLAIMING THEY ARE AHL AT-TASAWOOF

There are some people inbetween  society who  claim that they are ahl  at-tasawoof and  showing themselves as if they are of them(ahl at-tasawoof) by putting on such clothes  they wear or acting like them. But when their actions,situations and words are considered, it would be seen  that they  have nothing to do with ahl at-tasawoof. Such kind of people are away from tasawoof and ahl at-tasawoof.
Because of this, it's wajib upon us to know  the conditions and the actions of ahl at-tasawoof and distinguish the people who claim that they are ahl at-tasawoof from them. Because there's  a great difference between  them. ln  fact,  just as  when a  person puts himself into conditions and actions against islam he cannot stain islam; such kind of people  cannot stain  ahl at-tasawoof truly by their actions and words. There will be both khair(goodness) and shar(badness) amongst every jamaah till qiyamah. Just as the way muddarrisses(ulama),  mufaqqeeh(ulama of fiqh) and merchants are different from eachother, ahl at-tasawoof and people who claim they are of them are different from eacother as well. So, we have to know the people who stick to the shariah of Allahu  Zuljalaal and the sunnah of Sayyiduna Prophet akaihis salatu wassalaam and follow them  This is the most important duty of us.
