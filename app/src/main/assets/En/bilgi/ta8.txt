What is Tasawoof?

We can define tasawoof like this using its own terms. Tasawoof: is a spiritual ilm which contains the situations of the zahir and the batın's reparation, aqhlaq's purification and the nafs's clearance with the goal of reaching happiness forever. 
The common definition is this:
Application of the rules of islam by muslims, both in zahir and batin, upon azimah and taqwah without benefitting permissions.
As for tasawoof is a spiritual way of life, in reality it could be told and understood by living it personally, feeling it and getting into the states of it. This is the reason for we run into different expressions and definitions in books of tasawoof. While scholars of islam defining tasawoof according to their own spiritual lives, some of them defined it by the beginning states, some defined by advanced states, sometimes they defined with signs, and sometimes they defined it according to its basis. Although we run into different definitions, they all unite in the definition which is meant. ln reality tasawoof, is to be wrapped into the attributes of believer which Allahu Zuljalaal wants and to try to have the morals of the Prophet alaihissalatu wassalam whom Allahu Zuljalaal granted highest morals. 
Tasawoof is such an ilm that batil(false) could neither come behind from it or get ahead of it. There's not crookedness neither behind it nor in front of it. Because tasawoof is a noor(divine light) which is taken from the candle of prophecy. There's no noor for us to get beyond prophecy.
