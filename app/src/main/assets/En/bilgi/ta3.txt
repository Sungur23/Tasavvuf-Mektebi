Necessities of Being a Mureed

The conditions of the people who want to be  friend of us:

1. He has to have a certain belief about us coming from a "Habl-i Mateen-i Rabbani", "Urwa-i Vusqa-i llaahi" silsilah and having icazah and being in charge of the duty of inspiration, practise, expression.

2. Repenting for his previous sins -in the condition of not returning them-, holding onto the orders and bans of our exalted religion as much as he can.

3. Having a yaqeen faith that he would gain the consent of Allah Subhana wa Taala by his strong love to Allah Subhana wa Taala.

4. After togetherness and commitment happened, not willing for showing either sooree or kawnee karamah(oracles). Not even in his innerself. (lf it happens unwillingly, then he doesn't need to do anything about it).

5.  Giving more importance to the life of akhirah, because leaving dunia is a must for the person who is willing (the consent of) Haqq and akhirah and because it's not possible to gather two opposite thing together. Never ever preferring the temporary worldly life over the consent of Allah Subhana wa Taala and meeting Him subhana wa taala. And making progress by being upset continuously because him not being able to leave every single thing for Him subhana wa taala.

6.  Trying to accept happily and apply the spiritual duties which he would learn from his hodja or imam. And accepting these as the happiness of the two worlds for himself.

7.  After the connection is made, protecting it in a good way and scaring the big and infinite responsibility of the situations and behaviours which breaks the coming the covenant true. And it's a must feeling this fear all the time."
